Cloth simulation started Oct 11 2016

- Template Vector3 class - DONE
- Decent Makefile
- setup in openGL then webGL
- parallelisation openMP / MPI
- vector representation of data structure 

steps:

-implement constrains (ignore boundary)
-implement vmax and vmin
-need to think about how to visualise array of particles using openGL

IDEAS FOR NEXT PROJECT
- 3D cloth - GPU implementation 
- Stickman
-
